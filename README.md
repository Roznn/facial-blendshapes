abstract = {Blendshape facial rigs are used extensively in the industry for facial animation of 
virtual humans. However, storing and manipulating large numbers of facial meshes is costly
in terms of memory and computation for gaming applications, yet the relative perceptual 
importance of blendshapes has not yet been investigated. Research in Psychology and Neuroscience
has shown that our brains process faces differently than other objects, so we postulate that 
the perception of facial expressions will be feature-dependent rather than based purely on the 
amount of movement required to make the expression. In this paper, we explore the noticeability
of blendshapes under different activation levels, and present new perceptually based models to
predict perceptual importance of blendshapes. The models predict visibility based on commonly-used 
geometry and image-based metrics. },
